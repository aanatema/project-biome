## node_modules and .env issue

At moments, I rushed the developpement of this project and did not pay enough attention to my pushes, and on some older branches you can see that the node_modules and .env are present. 
Now, all sensitive information has been removed and changed to ensure the security of this project. I will pay more attention to the subject in the future.
